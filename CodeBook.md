My columns correspond to the means and standard deviations of the following quantities. Data was obtained via an accelerometer and broken down by body and gravitational signals.The "t" prefix indicates time, and the "f" signifies frequency after a fast fourier transform. The "XYZ" suffix indicates data present in three axes.
